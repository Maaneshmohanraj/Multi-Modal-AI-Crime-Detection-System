• Pioneered a real-time surveillance system utilizing YOLOv9 and Vision Transformers, attaining 83% threat
detection accuracy.
• Constructed multi-modal fusion architecture with GPT-4V and Whisper, lowering false positives by 45%.
• Established a GraphQL API and React Native cross-platform app managing 1000+ camera feeds in real time.
• Streamlined performance through Edge Computing and Vector DB, yielding 60% less latency and 40% cost savings.
